### Design Doc
See `/root/.claude/uploads/a51bf48d-c5a6-565a-8cbf-494156e446c8/b08ff15b-_________v1_1.md`

### Key Constraints
- **NO TIMERS** - Adults should never feel rushed
- **Copyright-free games only** - Historical games (Honinbo Shusaku, etc.) + user games only
- **Lightweight Go engine** - GNU Go via Cloud Functions for cost efficiency
- **3-tap Aha path** - Splash → Onboarding → Home → AI Game → Capture Stone
- **Dark mode only** - Premium adults-only design
- **Chinese rules** - End-game detection uses Chinese scoring

### Technology Stack
```
Frontend: Flutter/Dart 3.x + Riverpod + Lottie
Backend: Firebase (Firestore/Auth/Functions/Analytics/Crashlytics/Remote Config)

### Running the App

```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run in debug (iOS simulator)
flutter run -d ios

# Run in debug (Android emulator)
flutter run -d android

# Lint & analyze
dart format lib/
dart analyze
```

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Services (engine API, Firestore mocks) - 50%+ coverage
- **Widget tests**: Screens (onboarding, game, paywall)
- **Integration tests**: Critical paths (Auth → Onboarding → Aha)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (lint → test → coverage)

### Firebase Setup

1. Create Firebase project: `goen-project`
2. Run FlutterFire CLI: `flutterfire configure`
   - This auto-generates `firebase_options.dart`
   - Updates Android & iOS configs
3. Enable services:
   - Firestore Database (Production mode)
   - Cloud Functions (GNU Go endpoint)
   - Cloud Storage (game images/exports)
   - Analytics (automatic + custom events)
   - Crashlytics (auto-collection)
   - Remote Config (feature flags)

### Firestore Collections

```
users/{uid}
  - email, displayName, subscriptionActive, tutorialCompleted, etc.
  
gameRecords/{id}
  - uid, boardSize, sgfData, result, aiLevel, playedAt
  
tsumeGoProblems/{id}
  - difficulty, sgfData, solutionSgf, explanation, source, createdAt
  
userTsumeGoLogs/{id}
  - uid, problemId, isCorrect, solvedAt, attemptCount
  
kifuLibrary/{id}
  - title, players, sgfData, aiCommentaryData, category, source, createdAt
  
observationLogs/{id}
  - uid, kifuId, watchedAt, completedRate
```

### Analytics Events

```dart
// Track critical metrics
analytics.logEvent(
  name: 'aha_moment_reached',
  parameters: {'board_size': 9, 'timestamp': DateTime.now().toIso8601String()},
);

analytics.logEvent(
  name: 'ai_game_completed',
  parameters: {'result': 'win', 'ai_level': 3},
);

analytics.logEvent(
  name: 'tsumego_solved',
  parameters: {'difficulty': 2, 'attempts': 1},
);

analytics.logEvent(
  name: 'paywall_triggered',
  parameters: {'game_number': 3},
);

analytics.logEvent(
  name: 'paywall_converted',
  parameters: {'plan': 'annual', 'price': 9.99},
);
```

### Key Files Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `pubspec.yaml` | Dependencies & metadata |
| `lib/main.dart` | Entry point |
| `lib/config/theme.dart` | Dark theme & colors |
| `lib/models/index.dart` | All data models |
| `lib/services/index.dart` | Business logic layer |
| `lib/viewmodels/index.dart` | Riverpod state management |
| `lib/viewmodels/PROVIDERS.md` | Provider usage guide |
| `README.md` | Full project documentation |
| `CLAUDE.md` | This file - quick reference |

### Common Patterns

**Firestore Read (Riverpod Provider):**
```dart
final gameProvider = FutureProvider.family<GameRecord, String>((ref, gameId) async {
  final service = ref.watch(firestoreServiceProvider);
  return service.getGameRecord(gameId);
});
```

**Cloud Function Call:**
```dart
final aiMove = await goEngineService.requestAiMove(
  boardState: currentBoard,
  aiLevel: 5,
);
```

**Analytics Event:**
```dart
ref.watch(analyticsProvider).logEvent(
  name: 'aha_moment_reached',
  parameters: {...},
);
```

### Important Reminders

1. **Always use Riverpod** for state - no setState()
2. **Firestore batch writes** for consistency (especially game records)
3. **Cloud Functions timeout**: 15 seconds, 2 retries max
4. **Chinese rules**: Implement end-game detection correctly
5. **No timers**: Remove any time-pressure mechanics
6. **Error handling**: Always catch and log Network, Auth, Firestore errors
7. **Testing**: Mock Firestore & Cloud Functions
